# Probability that l integers are relatively prime

In this paper you will find  the result and the proof of the probability that l integers are relatively prime where l is an integer.

Let $l \in \mathbb{N}^{\star}$, denote $A_l$: the probability that l integers are relatively prime where l is an integer. It will be proved in the article that :
$$\mathbb{P} (A_l) = \frac{1}{\zeta (l)}$$
